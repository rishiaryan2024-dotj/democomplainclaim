# Notes:
# - faiss: use faiss-cpu on Windows or the appropriate build for your environment. If deploying to Streamlit Cloud,
#   faiss may not be available; consider using an alternative vector store or building the index locally and uploading it.
# - ollama and groq are external services; ensure their CLIs/SDKs are available and API keys set in the environment.
# - faster-whisper and pytesseract may require system-level dependencies (FFmpeg, Tesseract OCR).
